    <p>I am an idoit who is about to start a new life in a completely different country
    and also a person who has literally little to no understanding of how the outside world works.
    help me, I just don't want to end up as a failure and a big fucking disappointment to my family.
    A family who has high hopes from me.
    please god just be with me. I am ready to do the hard lifting, but just be my side.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First of them setbacks hits you the hardest.</li>
        <li>shit man, I don't even know what I'm doing with my life at this point now.
             Failed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Entrance_Examination">JEE</a>, failed in my <a href="https://www.collegesearch.in/bsc-in-india#:~:text=BSc%20is%20a%20three%2Dyear,%2C%20Nursing%20and%20Agriculture%2C%20etc.">BSC</a> exams, failed in making my parents feel proud.
             So basically, everything that someone can fail at, I've already had.
             What's even the point to keep pushing now.</li>
        <li>Secondly the RR of me and my friends</li>
        <li>Again bro, I am telling you to enjoy your life while you can. These high school days will never
        return.</li>
